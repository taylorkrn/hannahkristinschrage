Title: About Me

----

Text:

I am Hannah, freelance Illustrator and Designer living and working in Berlin.

My images focus on human interactions,relationships and everything in between.The illustrations translate aspects of everyday life, through an embracement of the Absurd, into fun and comical scenes.

With a background in graphic design, I look to communicate emotional and authentic images through a combination of free-hand work and geometric forms in digital illustration.

Title: About Me

Text:

<strong>I am Hannah</strong>, a freelance Illustrator and Designer living and working in Berlin.<br><br>

My images focus on human interactions,relationships and everything in between.The illustrations translate aspects of everyday life, through an embracement of the Absurd, into fun and comical scenes.<br><br>

With a background in graphic design, I look to communicate emotional and authentic images through a combination of free-hand work and geometric forms in digital illustration.
